            <p> Hello, My name is <b>Keith Cesar Dela Cruz Bangi</b>. I used to get annoyed writing all that in my papers back then. But now that I'm a little older I think it’s cool and I like it. Anyways, I was born and raised in Philippines, in a city where there’s no large buildings but a place where people are happy and everyone knows each other. I came to America when I was 16 because my parents wanted me to further my education. Education was really important for my parents and also to give me a chance to land a job so that I would have a better future for myself. Which means more $$$ to spend in gadgets. But instead of going to college after high school, I joined the military. I did not go to college because I wouldn't want to go to school if I’m not passionate about anything they offer. Back then I always hear in the news where a lot of young people died for their country. I thought to myself how foolish can they be giving their own life instead of living. Until it hunted me down where I found my own reason to join. I had this voice in my head to do it not because of the country, which I appreciate for giving me all this opportunity. But because I was amazed by all this young people sacrificing their life. Who would have though that I would go to a Marine recruiter asking for an infantry job knowing I could lose my own life. The only thing in my head back then was I wanted to be there, just incase someone need my help someway somehow I'm there and maybe save someones life. Luckily I did not experience bad memories while I was there. I'm thankful I've been through those experience because I wouldn't be the person I am today if I went straight to school.</p>
            <p>  At the end of my service I thought knew I had to go to back to school to learn the skill I'm passionate about. I just had to figure out what I wanted to do everyday for the rest of my life. Until I realized I've always had this hidden passion in technology. I’m always browsing, tweaking stuff and always curious what's going on behind it. Thats what brought me to learn coding. Now I am an aspiring web developer. I’m excited, I know this journey won’t be easy but I believe something good will happen and it will be worth it.</p>
